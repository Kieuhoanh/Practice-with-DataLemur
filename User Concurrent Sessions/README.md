# Question

Assume you are given the table below containing information on user sessions, including their start and end times. Write a query to obtain the user session that is concurrent with the other user sessions.

Output the session id and number of concurrent user sessions.

## Assumptions:

- Sessions with the same start and end time are not considered concurrrent sessions.
- Concurrent sessions are defined as overlapping sessions:
1. If session 1 starts first, then the session 2's start time is greater than or lesser than session 1â€™s end time.
2. If session 2 starts first, then session 1â€™s end time is greater than or lesser than session 2â€™s start time.

ðŸ“Œ`sessions` __Table__:
|Column Name|	Type|
|---|----|
|session_id|	integer|
|start_time	|datetime|
|end_time|	datetime|

ðŸ“Œ`sessions` __Example Input__:
|session_id|	start_time	|end_time|
|---|----|----|
|746382|	01/02/2022 12:00:00|	02/01/2022 16:48:00|
|143145|	01/02/2022 14:25:00|	02/01/2022 15:05:00|
|134514|	01/02/2022 15:23:00|	02/01/2022 18:15:00|
|242354|	01/02/2022 21:34:00|	03/01/2022 00:11:00|
|143256|	01/06/2022 06:55:00|	01/06/2022 09:05:00|

__Example Output:__
|session_id|	concurrent_sessions|
|-----|---|
|143256|	1|
|746382|	2|

__Explanation__
- Session 746382 has 2 concurrent sessions which are session_id 134514 and 242354.

- Session 746382's end time, 02/01/2022 16:48:00, is before session 134514's end time of 02/01/2022 18:15:00.
- Session 746382's end time, 02/01/2022 16:48:00, is before session 242354's end time of 03/01/2022 00:11:00.
